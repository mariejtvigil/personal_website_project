		<h2>Purpose</h2>

	<!--???-->

		<div class="item1">
			<h3>&hellip;it was drummed into me from an early age that humility is a virtue, and bragging, well… not so much.</h3>
				<p> My parents, both humble to the core, told us that if we worked hard, and did a good job (at school, in athletics, or elsewhere) we’d be recognized for our effort and rewarded accordingly.

					For the most part, it was good advice. However, in today’s competitive workplace, if <em><strike>your</strike> &#40;my&#41; plan to get ahead</em> is based on the assumption that hard work alone will suffice, you may find yourself being left behind as the horn blowers around you land the opportunities you anticipated were yours.</p>


			<h3>Principles to promote myself with confidence&mdash;<br />
				<small>without being labed a braggart.</small></h3>
					<p>1. <strong>Promote my value</strong>&mdash;reframe my experience and expertise in terms of the value I have to contribute.</p>
					<p>2. <strong>Share examples, not ego</strong>&mdash;share examples of something I’ve done that conveysmy accomplishments, capabilities and aspirations.</p>
					<p>3. <strong>Be strategic</strong>&mdash;be relevant in what I share, whom I share it with and how I communicate my experience.</p>
					<p>4. <strong>Publicly recognizing the accomplishments of others</strong>&mdash;self-promotion is not just about me. It’s about me, my team, and our organization.</p>
					<p>5. <strong>Be a risk-taker</strong>&mdash;letting fear of failure determine what I say or do is a sure-fire way to never achieve the success I want in life.</p>
