##PWP M.S. 1 Feedback
Awesome Milestone 1 - everything is complete, and meets expectations. Great job. Nice use of CSS. Great start with your code, but there are a few errors and suggestions I've noted below. Nothing too major. You do not need to spend time to correct these, just take note. Your Milestone one passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)

###Suggestions
* Create an /css directory at the root of your project, and place all css files here. 

###Corrections
1. Create a /documentation directory at the root of your project, and place all milestone files here, as per [PWP documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-one/).
2. Rename index_summary.html to milestone-1.php
1. **.gitignore** - remove .html from file name
2. **index_summary.html**
  1. line 19: closing tag is empty.
  2. line 29: A &lt;main&gt; tag is more appropriate here, rather than a &lt;section&gt;. It also is missing a closing tag.
