									<p>
									Outbound Marketing, or traditional marketing, can include printed advertisements, such as newsletters, billboards, flyers and magazine
									print ads. Other forms of traditional marketing include television commercials, as well as radio spots
									advertising a business, product, or service. Printed posters utilized as signage inform viewers of limited promotions. With traditional marketing, anyone with a newspaper, mail service, television, radio or sitting at a coffee shop can learn of your business.
									As a business using traditional marketing, you bring your message to potential customers.
									</p>
									<p>

									create brand recongition and increase your online presence by advertising your blog or social media networks.

									<p>
									Well, first let&rsquo;s look at what is a Cognitive Marketing approach to Design.
									Simply put, Cognitive Design means to design with intent&mdash;to solve problems by thinking about the situation from many view points.
									In Cognitive Design, a designer approaches problem solving as an engineer, rather than an artist, providing a practical set of collaborative tools
									and methods for planning and defining a successful designed product.
									The traditional thought that a square peg will fit into a round hole or a one-size-fits-all design process will not develop into innovatative solutions.
									One answer, cause we have always done it that way, is not the perfect fit for many situations. With Cognitive Design or Design Thinking many possible answers are created and evaluated
									for one solution to one root-cause situation.
									</p>
									<p>
									Asking key questions focused on the root of a situation is how simple, resourceful, and intuitive solutions are built.
									</p>
									<p>
									Question: How do you keep people from bringing mud into the house?
									</p>
									<p>
									Answer: Why is it muddy outside?
