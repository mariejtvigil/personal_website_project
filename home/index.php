										clients that match how and when they want to interact with your services.

									<h4 class="aligncenter">What is a Cognitive Marketing approach to Design?</h4>
									<p>
										Simply put, it means to design with intent&mdash;to solve problems by thinking about the situation from many view points.
										In Cognitive Design, a designer approaches problem solving as a science, rather than an art, providing a practical set of collaborative tools
										and methods for planning and defining a successful designed product.
										It goes back to the traditional thought that a square peg will fit into a round hole or a one-size-fits-all thought process.
										Where there is one answer for many solutions. With Cognitive Design or Design Thinking many possible answers are reviewed
										for one solution to one root-cause situation.<br/>
										<br/>Question: How do you keep people from bringing mud into the house?<br/><br/>
										Answer: Why is it muddy outside?
