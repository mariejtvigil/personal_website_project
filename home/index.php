									<p>
									Well, first let&rsquo;s look at what is a Cognitive Marketing approach to Design.
									Simply put, Cognitive Design means to design with intent&mdash;to solve problems by thinking about the situation from many view points.
									In Cognitive Design, a designer approaches problem solving as an engineer, rather than an artist.
									The traditional thought that a square peg will fit into a round hole or a one-size-fits-all design process will not develop into innovatative solutions.
									</p>
									<p>
									Asking the right key questions at the right time is how user and business needs are both meet.
									</p>
									<p>
									Question: How do you keep people from bringing mud into the house?</br>
									Answer: Why is it muddy outside?
