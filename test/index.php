					<h2>Cognitive Marketing<h2>
						<p class="paragraph">
							With Cognitive Design, Design Thinking, User Experience Design, and the use of data warehouse architecture many possible answers are evaluated
							to define one final solution. Asking key questions focused on the root of
							a situation is how simple, resourceful, and intuitive solutions are built. In other words, it’s more important to solve the right problem than to design the perfect solution.
						</p>
						<p class="paragraph">
							As designers within a business,  it’s our job to solve a business problem first, than create a thing of beauty second.
							We need to frame design problems as business problems as well as identify concerns though a scientific microscope.
							Why and how does a design of an interface or view benefit the user AND create a Return On Investment (ROI) for the company.
						</p>
						<p class="paragraph">
							Product development and design is a cyclical process. Creativity during the innovation phase is often based on user experience and artistry.
							Collected data during the innovation phase can direct designers and developers to a broken step in the user flow.
							Data that directs your attention to the problem won’t tell us how to fix the problem but aids us in finding a solution.
						</p>
						<p class="paragraph">
							Data and analysis should ultimately be part of the design process and not just a marketing process.
							Designers can’t afford to rely on their instincts alone. Designers can learn from other departments wealth of data.
							Applying the right data at the right time within the right design stage is an important element to the future of design.
							Marketing, design, and development go hand-in-hand in building, launching, and selling a successful product.
							That is a cognitive marketing approach to design.

					<h2>Staying Focused</h2>
					<p class="focus-paragraph">
						Often we lose focus within the design and development stages. We get distracted, off-track, or scope creep sets in.
						Scope creep occurs when the scope of a project is not properly defined, documented, or controlled.
						Scope creep is harmful to the project and often causes damage to a team environment.
						Collaboration, mutual respect, open communication, and teamwork are the keys to successful problem
						solving as much as asking the right questions and doing the right amount of research at the beginning of the project.
						Don't let scope creep complicate the design and development process. Know when to say no and when to make the right except for the right reason.
